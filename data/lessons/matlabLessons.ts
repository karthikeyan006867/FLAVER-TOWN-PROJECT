MATLAB is a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to analyze and design systems.

## Key Features:
- Matrix-based language
- Excellent for numerical analysis
- Built-in plotting and visualization
- Extensive toolboxes
- Simulink integration

## Hello World:
\`\`\`matlab
disp('Hello, MATLAB!')
\`\`\`

## Variables and Matrices:

name = 'MATLAB';
age = 40;
matrix = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
