SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing relational databases.

## Key Concepts:
- Tables: Store data in rows and columns
- Queries: Retrieve data from tables
- CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete

## Basic Commands:
\`\`\`sql
-- Select all data
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT name, email FROM users;

-- Filter with WHERE
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;

-- Order results
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;
\`\`\`

## Creating Tables:
\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  age INT
);
\`\`\``,
    language: 'sql',

  grade INT,
  enrollment_date DATE
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO students (name, grade, enrollment_date)
VALUES ('Alice', 95, '2024-01-15');

-- Query data
SELECT name, grade

## Types of Joins:
\`\`\`sql
-- INNER JOIN: Matching records from both tables
SELECT users.name, orders.order_date
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;

-- LEFT JOIN: All from left, matching from right
SELECT users.name, orders.order_date

-- RIGHT JOIN: All from right, matching from left
SELECT users.name, orders.order_date
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
\`\`\`

## Aggregate Functions:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

SELECT MAX(price) FROM products;
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders;
