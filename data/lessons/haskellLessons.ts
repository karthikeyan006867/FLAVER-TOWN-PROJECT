    content: `# Introduction to Haskell

Haskell is a purely functional programming language with strong static typing and lazy evaluation.

## Key Features:
- Pure functional (no side effects)
- Lazy evaluation
- Strong static typing
- Type inference
- Pattern matching

## Hello World:
\`\`\`haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"
\`\`\`

## Basic Values:
\`\`\`haskell
number = 42
name = "Haskell"
isTrue = True
listOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
\`\`\`

## Functions:
\`\`\`haskell
double x = x * 2
add x y = x + y
